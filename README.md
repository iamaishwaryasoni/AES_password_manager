# AES_password_manager
The application is a Java password manager that makes use of Swing for its graphical user interface. With the help of a master password, users may both encrypt and decrypt passwords. AES encryption with CBC mode and PKCS5Padding is used to encode and decrypt the passwords.

Qualities:

Password encryption and decryption: Using a master password, users can encrypt and decode their passwords as needed.
File Storage: For future use, encrypted passwords are kept in a file called "encrypted_password.txt".
AES Encryption: To provide strong security, the program uses AES encryption with CBC mode and PKCS5 padding.
User-Friendly Interface: Users may interact with the decryption capability straightforwardly and naturally thanks to the GUI.
